➡️DALL-E 

•DALL-E is a combination of two models, CLIP and diffused attention.
    •CLIP, is a model that generates embeddings, which are numerical representations of data, from images and text.
    •Diffused attention, is a model that generates images from embeddings. 
•DALL-E is trained on a dataset of images and text and can be used to generate images from text descriptions. 
•For example, DALL-E can be used to generate images of a cat in a hat, or a dog with a mohawk.


➡️Midjourney
•Midjourney, can also be used to generate images using prompts like “a cat in a hat”, or a “dog with a mohawk”.

➡️How does DALL-E and Midjourney Work ❓
◽DALL-E : based on the transformer architecture with an autoregressive transformer.
    ▶️autoregressive transformer
    •defines how a model generates images from text descriptions
    •generates one pixel at a time, and then uses the generated pixels to generate the next pixel
    •Passing through multiple layers in a neural network, until the image is complete.


➡️Temperature is a parameter that controls the randomness of the output of a Generative AI model. The temperature is a value between 0 and 1 where 0 means that the output is deterministic and 1 means that the output is random.


➡️Define boundaries for your application with metaprompts
•Metaprompts are text prompts that are used to control the output of a Generative AI model. 
•they are positioned before the text prompt
•For example, we can use metaprompts to control the output, and ensure that the generated images are safe for work, or appropriate for children.
