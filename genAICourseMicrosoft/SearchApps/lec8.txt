Semantic Search = Intent Based 
Semantic search is a search technique that uses the semantics, or meaning, of the words in a query to return relevant results.

Eg: "my dream watch"
Keyword search : dream and watch --> iske according response dega which can/will be irrelevant
Semantic search : my ideal watch --> iske according response dega which will be relevant!!


➡️Vectors v/s Embeddings

•Text embeddings are a text representation technique used in natural language processing.
•Text embeddings are semantic numerical representations of text. 
•Embeddings are used to represent data in a way that is easy for a machine to understand.
•Special type of vector that is generated by LLM that has semantic meaning

Embedding engine <---(i/p diya (text))
        | (o/p)
        V
a vector (this will have the semantic meaning of the text that is sent in i/p)


Nearest Neighbour Search 
•We've collection of vectors (embeddings model ka o/p) 
•Now I'll search which vector is closest to my example(let's say "my dream watch")
•We used cosine similarity for that


How the search actually work ??
•Take complete transcript
•Make chunks of it (let's say of 3 mins) : it depends upon kitne mein search krna hai tumhe (3min increment ya 5 min and so on )
•Also we just do not cut off the chunck blindly ; we do a overlap so that it gives us a better context 
•Then these chunks will go to the embeddings 
•This will return a vector (for eg. 1:1536) if we're using "ADA model"
•Those vectors will be stored in Vector Store 
    ◽Now we need to search for the query(eg: RStudio and Notebooks) in the store
• So first we'll generate a embedding for the query
•then will apply Nearest Neighbour or cosine similarity against my store
•Now in the result we got suppose have a timestamp as well so we will be redirected to that video + on the timestamp where it is talking about the query we have given (RStudio and Notebooks).

•So we'll be getting both relevant videos + timestamp where the query is being taken in account or been discussed.
