➡️     Chatbots                              v/s                      Chat Application 

•Set of prescribed fine scripts & rules                     •New and context relevant responses in real time
•Task-Focused and rule based	                            •Context-aware
•Often integrated into larger systems	                    •May host one or multiple chatbots
•Limited to programmed functions	                        •Incorporates generative AI models
•Specialized & structured interactions	                    •Capable of open-domain discussions

◽We can also apply customization through process called Fine-Tuning
•Used when pre-trained model falls short in a specialized domain or specific task 

Steps
•Base model lenege that we'll train it with our training data.
•Select training data (clean , format takes place)
•Choice to apply hyperparameters
    •Eg: No. of epochs
•Start training the model with the dataset
•Then we can use this fine-tuned model


◽We can also apply customization through RAG
•IRS that provides grounding data
•In this there is no extra training ; the LLM is been pre-trained using public data and generates responses that are augumented by info from the retriever
