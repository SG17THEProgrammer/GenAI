➡️Core Concepts
•Fabrication / Hallucination : AI genrated something which is not a fact 
•Prompt Engg. : In this we iteratively give prompts and analyze/evaluate it for the quality till we get the response we want.

With prompt engg. we see how can we adjust variables(see image) so that we can get the best response for the prompt that we have given.

➡️Why PE?

◽Models are stochastic : For same i/p the model will give different o/p everytime. It may be incorrect and not according to your choice.

◽Models can fabricate response (*Interesting*): 
    •Eg. If we give a question like "Tell me the premise for the movie that won the 2026 best movie oscar" so some model like gpt-3.5-turbo will just make up something which really hasn't happened . 
    That's fabrication  (See image -> fabrication)

    •But better models like gpt-4-turbo will say that I can't deal with it as 2026 hasn't happened.
    (See image -> gpt-4-turbo)

    •Prompt engineering techniques like metaprompting and temperature configuration may reduce model fabrications to some extent.

◽Models capabilities will vary 
    Prompt engineering can help us develop best practices and workflows that abstract away differences and adapt to model-specific requirements in scalable, seamless ways



➡️Prompt Engg. Techniques (See image --> Techniques)
We can play with our prompts and accordingly we'll getting the response 
•If you write prompt in some pattern it will give response according to that 

◽In Zero shot it kind of completes the sentence 
◽In few shots it follows the example/pattern you have provided.
